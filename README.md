# Object Oriented Programming - Car Reservation System

This is the technical diagram I created that shows how the car reservation system is structured. 
It features State diagram, State chart, Activity diagram, Sequence diagram.  These diagrams help with understanding design elements to improve the overall project development.



## 1. State Diagram

The basic purpose of this state diagram is to portray various changes in state of the class and not the processes or commands causing the changes.
